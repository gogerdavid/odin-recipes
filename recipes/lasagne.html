    <h1>Lasagne</h1>

    <p>This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the Bolognese Chamber of Commerce. 
        I've made a couple of changes suggested to me by people from the area, such as which 
        meat and wine to use or if there should be milk added or not. One thing never in question, 
        though, is the green lasagne sheets.

        These are a must. The ragu is an authentic sauce, 
        simple without garlic or herbs and spices. Using fresh pasta keeps you from having to 
        pre-boil it.
